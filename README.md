# A self-pace Learning technique to master C, Python - How Cool!

### Dear FutureMe,

Am writing from your years past, when you took the challenge to chart a new
course of your life -when you decided to be a programmer, an ideal thinker, an
outstanding tech ace achiever, and all the rest of the catch fun with your
precious time in life.

This is where I choose to dump all my practice codes, just so my FutureMe
would grab a bowl of popcorn, and a chill mug of icecream to smile upon
-throwing back on my early days of playing around C, python and other
programming languages s they would come in handy; doodling and
scribbling and writing texts upon texts filling my books with stuffs i didn't
understand then but were worth safekeeping with a pen inside a book.

I heard a wise man say, **"The only way to justify privilege is by doing hard
things."** Hmm -those words energized me!

## The theory of GRIT as a predictor of success

### *We need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier*

"The significant predictor of success, -it wasn't social intelligence, it wasn't
good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.
`GRIT` is that significant
predictor of success separating the successful students from those who
struggled.
`GRIT` is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.
`GRIT` is having stamina.
`GRIT` is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not
just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a
reality.
`GRIT` is living life like its a marathon, not a sprint.
**Talent doesn't make you gritty**"

Happy codingüçø
